I wanted the comments form to appear above the list of comments, so I added a control to the comment element.

== Description ==


=== Fields ===

==== Show form before comments ====

If checked, the comments form appears before the comments.

==== Gap ***(only visible if "Show form before comments" is checked)*** ====

Sets the gap between the form and the comments below. The default unit is `px` but `em, rem, %` units can also be used.

==== Form Label ====

The standard label of the form is `Comment *`. With this field it can be changed to what ever you want. The `*` will be
included automatically so leave it out.

If you want to change the CSS of the `*` you can use the `.required` class or target the `<span>` within the `<label
for="comment">`.

=== Technical stuff ===

If the setting is true, the elements `.comments-title` and `.comment-list` will be wrapped with `<div
class="comments__wrapper"></div>` and a CSS file will be enqueued.

It also adds a skiplink to the comments form right after `<div id='comments'>`.

==== CSS ====

The `.bricks-comments-inner` will get `display: grid` and `.comments_wrapper`will get `order: 1`.
